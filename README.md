# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each year's set of puzzles is represented by a folder, and the solutions are implemented in Go.

The puzzles are designed to be completed one per day, leading up to Christmas. In this repository, you will find solutions to various problems from the Advent of Code platform, starting with Day 1.
